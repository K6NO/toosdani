            "description" : "is a redesign of an existing outdoor furniture family from IDEA. The original named Monaco is an imitation of polyrattan, made from polypropylene with injection moulding. I changed everything radical. My main ambition was to design it more ergonomic, to compensate the hardness of polypropylene, and for this I also used thick cushions. To soften the block-like impression I decided to make it clear, so the user can estimate its weight better. It doesnâ€™t want to look better or imitate something more special."
